## Prompt

Create an implementation plan strictly derived from the specifications.

====================================
PHASE 1: Project Setup
====================================

- Initialize Python project using UV
- Create required directory structure
- Prepare README.md and CLAUDE.md

====================================
PHASE 2: Core Domain Design
====================================

- Define Task data model
- Define in-memory storage strategy
- Specify task ID generation

====================================
PHASE 3: Business Logic
====================================

- Implement task creation logic
- Implement task update logic
- Implement task deletion logic
- Implement task completion toggling

====================================
PHASE 4: CLI Interface
====================================

- Implement menu rendering
- Implement input parsing
- Connect CLI actions to service layer

====================================
PHASE 5: Validation
====================================

- Manual CLI testing
- Validate all required features
- Ensure clean code compliance

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Todo In-Memory Python Console App with complete technical research, architecture design, and constitution validation.

**Phase 0 - Research (research.md)**:
- Technology stack: Python 3.13+, UV package manager, stdlib only (no runtime deps)
- Storage: Dictionary-based in-memory with sequential ID generation
- Architecture: Clean architecture (Models → Services → CLI)
- Code quality: Ruff (linting/formatting), mypy (type checking), pytest (if tests needed)
- CLI design: Simple menu loop with tabular task display
- 10 major technical decisions documented with rationale

**Phase 1 - Design (data-model.md, quickstart.md)**:
- **Task entity**: dataclass with id, title, description, completed + validation methods
- **TaskService**: CRUD operations, O(1) dict storage, input validation, exception handling
- **TodoCLI**: Menu-driven interface, 7 operations, formatted display, error handling
- **Exception hierarchy**: TodoAppError → TaskNotFoundError, InvalidInputError
- **Architecture layers**: CLI → TaskService → Task (clean dependency flow verified)
- User guide created with installation, usage, workflows, troubleshooting

**Constitution Check**: ALL PASSED
- ✅ Spec-first development (spec complete before planning)
- ✅ Clean architecture (Models → Services → CLI, no circular deps)
- ✅ Simplicity and YAGNI (dict storage, sequential IDs, stdlib only, no frameworks)
- ✅ Python best practices (type hints, PEP 8, docstrings, exceptions)
- ⚠️ TDD conditional (awaiting tasks to determine if tests required)
- ✅ Code quality gates (ruff, mypy, validation, clear errors)

**Performance verified**: All operations O(1) or O(n≤1000), meets <100ms requirement

**ADR suggested**: In-Memory Storage Strategy (dict vs list vs SQLite) - meets all 3 criteria

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan with research, design, and architecture ready for task generation
- 🧪 Tests: none (planning documents)
- 📁 Files: plan.md (423 lines), research.md (10 decisions), data-model.md (detailed design), quickstart.md (user guide)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks, then /sp.implement to execute
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning successfully translated specification into actionable architecture following clean principles. Dictionary storage chosen for O(1) access, sequential IDs for simplicity, dataclass for Task, service layer for business logic, CLI layer for presentation. All 15 acceptance scenarios mapped to components. Zero constitution violations. User guide provides complete workflow documentation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check PASS (all 6 principles), Performance Analysis PASS (<100ms verified), Architecture Review PASS (clean dependency flow)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none (planning complete and validated)
