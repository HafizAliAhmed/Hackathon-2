- Implement list_tasks()
- Implement update_task()
- Implement delete_task()
- Implement toggle_complete()

====================================
TASK GROUP: CLI Layer
====================================

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks organized by user story priority with strict checklist format and independent testability.

**Organization**: 50 tasks across 7 phases
- **Phase 1 - Setup (7 tasks)**: UV project init, directory structure, README, gitignore
- **Phase 2 - Foundational (5 tasks)**: Exception hierarchy, Task dataclass, TaskService skeleton, TodoCLI skeleton, entry point (BLOCKS all user stories)
- **Phase 3 - User Story 1/P1 (11 tasks)**: Add and View Tasks - MVP implementation
  - Task model methods (mark_complete, mark_incomplete)
  - TaskService (create_task, get_all_tasks)
  - TodoCLI (menu, input helpers, add/view handlers, main loop)
  - Independent test: Add task → View → Verify appears with ID and status
- **Phase 4 - User Story 2/P2 (7 tasks)**: Mark Complete/Incomplete
  - TaskService (get_task, mark_complete, mark_incomplete)
  - TodoCLI (int input, complete/incomplete handlers)
  - Independent test: Add → Mark complete → View → Mark incomplete → View
- **Phase 5 - User Story 3/P3 (5 tasks)**: Update Task Details
  - Task model (update_title, update_description)
  - TaskService (update_task)
  - TodoCLI (update handler)
  - Independent test: Add → Update title → View → Update description → View
- **Phase 6 - User Story 4/P4 (3 tasks)**: Delete Tasks
  - TaskService (delete_task)
  - TodoCLI (delete handler)
  - Independent test: Add → Delete → View (task gone)
- **Phase 7 - Polish (12 tasks)**: Type hints, docstrings, linting, type checking, end-to-end validation

**Format Validation**: ✅ ALL 50 tasks follow strict checklist format
- Checkbox: `- [ ]`
- Task ID: T001-T050 sequential
- [P] marker: 18 parallelizable tasks identified
- [Story] label: US1-US4 labels on user story tasks only
- File paths: Every task includes exact file path

**Dependencies**:
- Setup → Foundational (blocks ALL) → User Stories (can run parallel) → Polish
- User Story 1 is MVP (23 tasks: Setup + Foundational + US1)
- User Stories 2-4 all depend on US1 foundation but are independently testable

**Parallel Opportunities**: 18 tasks marked [P]
- Setup: 6 parallel tasks (directories, config files)
- Foundational: 2 parallel (exceptions, Task model)
- User Story 1: 2 parallel (Task methods)
- User Story 2: 4 parallel (service methods, handlers)
- User Story 3: 2 parallel (Task methods)
- Polish: 6 parallel (type hints, docstrings)

**MVP Scope**: Phase 1-3 = 23 tasks for working add/view functionality

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown ready for `/sp.implement` execution with clear user story organization
- 🧪 Tests: none (tests not requested per constitution Principle V - TDD conditional)
- 📁 Files: tasks.md (50 tasks, 7 phases, 350+ lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.implement to execute tasks in dependency order
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks successfully organized by user story priority (P1-P4) enabling incremental delivery. Each story independently testable. Foundation phase (T008-T012) blocks all stories ensuring clean architecture. MVP achievable with just 23 tasks (Setup + Foundation + US1). 18 parallel opportunities identified. All tasks include exact file paths and follow strict checkbox format. Manual validation approach taken per constitution (tests optional).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format Validation PASS (50/50 tasks use checkbox format), User Story Mapping PASS (all 4 stories covered), Dependency Analysis PASS (foundation blocks stories, stories independent)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none (tasks complete and validated)
