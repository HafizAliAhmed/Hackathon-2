## Prompt

Define the baseline specifications for the Todo In-Memory Python Console App.

====================================
SYSTEM SPECIFICATION
====================================

Application Type:
- Command-line interface (CLI)

Runtime:
- Python 3.13+
- Executed via terminal

Package Management:
- UV

====================================
FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS
====================================

Task Model:
- id: integer
- title: string
- description: string
- completed: boolean

In-Memory Storage:
- Tasks stored in a Python list during runtime only

CLI Capabilities:
- Display menu options
- Accept user input
- Print formatted output

====================================
NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
====================================

- Clean separation of concerns
- Readable, maintainable code
- No external databases or files
- Deterministic behavior

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Todo In-Memory Python Console App on branch 001-todo-cli.

**4 Prioritized User Stories**:
- P1: Add and View Tasks (MVP - core value proposition)
- P2: Mark Tasks Complete/Incomplete (essential tracking)
- P3: Update Task Details (valuable refinement capability)
- P4: Delete Tasks (list management)

**12 Functional Requirements** covering:
- Menu-driven interface with all CRUD operations
- Auto-generated unique integer IDs
- In-memory storage only
- Input validation and error handling
- Task display with status indicators
- Graceful exit mechanism

**Key Entity - Task**:
- id (integer, auto-generated, immutable)
- title (string, required)
- description (string, required)
- completed (boolean, defaults to false)

**7 Measurable Success Criteria** (technology-agnostic):
- Add/view workflow: 3 user actions
- Mark complete workflow: 2 user actions
- Performance: 1000 tasks under 100ms
- Feedback: all operations respond within 1 second
- Error handling: helpful messages guide users

**Validation**: All quality checklist items passed on first validation - no NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers, all requirements testable, success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete feature specification ready for planning phase with clear scope, priorities, and acceptance criteria
- 🧪 Tests: none (specification document)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-todo-cli/spec.md (160 lines), specs/001-todo-cli/checklists/requirements.md (validation passed)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan to design architecture and implementation approach
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully captures all 5 required features (add, view, update, delete, mark complete/incomplete) with independent user stories enabling incremental delivery. Zero clarifications needed by making informed defaults (sequential IDs, duplicates allowed, deterministic behavior, session-scoped lifetime).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Content Quality PASS, Requirement Completeness PASS, Feature Readiness PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none (specification complete and validated)
