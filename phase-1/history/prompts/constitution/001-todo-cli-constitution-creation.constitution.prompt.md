## Prompt

You are Claude Code operating as a senior Python engineer and spec-driven development agent.

Your mission is to design and implement a basic-level, in-memory Python console application using a strict Spec-Driven Development workflow powered by Spec-Kit Plus.

====================================
PROJECT OBJECTIVE
====================================

Build a command-line Todo application that:
- Stores all data in memory (no persistence)
- Demonstrates clean architecture and code quality
- Implements all required basic features
- Is developed entirely through specs, plans, tasks, and agentic execution

No manual coding is allowed outside of Claude Code execution.

====================================
CORE PRINCIPLES
====================================

- Spec-first development is mandatory
- No implementation before specification
- Each phase must be reviewable and auditable
- Favor clarity and simplicity over cleverness
- Follow clean code and Python best practices

====================================
REQUIRED FEATURES
====================================

The application must support:
1. Add a task (title + description)
2. View all tasks with status indicators
3. Update task details
4. Delete a task by ID
5. Mark tasks as complete or incomplete

====================================
FINAL DELIVERABLE
====================================

A working Python console application that:
- Runs via CLI
- Uses in-memory storage

## Response snapshot

Constitution v1.0.0 ratified for Todo CLI Application with 6 core principles:

1. **Spec-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: No implementation before complete specification with user stories, acceptance criteria, and approval
2. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns, single responsibility, inward dependencies, no circular dependencies
3. **Simplicity and YAGNI**: Build only specified features, no over-engineering, in-memory storage, delete unused code
4. **Python Best Practices**: PEP 8, type hints, docstrings, meaningful names, composition over inheritance, explicit error handling
5. **Test-Driven Development (When Tests Required)**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle, tests written first and must fail before implementation
6. **Code Quality Gates**: No linting/type errors, no security vulnerabilities, clear error messages, appropriate logging

Additional sections added:
- Quality Standards (code review, security, performance)
- Development Workflow (5-phase process: specify → plan → tasks → implement → document)
- Governance (authority, amendments, compliance, complexity justification)

All dependent templates reviewed and confirmed compatible.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project constitution established with complete governance framework for Todo CLI development
- 🧪 Tests: none (constitution document)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md (v1.0.0, 195 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.specify to create feature specification for Todo CLI
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully bridges user requirements (basic in-memory Todo app) with Spec-Kit Plus methodology, emphasizing simplicity and Python best practices while maintaining rigor through spec-driven workflow

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Template validation PASS, Placeholder check PASS, Consistency check PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none (constitution complete and ratified)
